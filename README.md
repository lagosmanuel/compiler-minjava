# MiniJava Compiler

This project implements a compiler for the **MiniJava** programming language, a
subset of Java designed for educational purposes. The compiler generates code
for a virtual machine developed by the **Compilers and Interpreters** course at
the _Department of Computer Science and Engineering_, _National University of
the South_. Visit the [website of the Department](https://cs.uns.edu.ar).

MiniJava supports **object-oriented programming**, allowing the definition of
classes, methods, constructors, and the use of attributes and local variables
with basic and user-defined types, as well as a simple structure for managing
inheritance and performing basic operations on objects.

## Objective

The main goal of this project is to provide a tool that translates source code
written in MiniJava into intermediate code that can be executed on a custom
virtual machine. This project is part of the **Compilers and Interpreters**
course, where fundamental concepts for the development of compilers and
programming languages are explored.

## Project Structure

The compiler is divided into several stages that correspond to the classic
phases of a compiler. The main stages are as follows:

1. **Lexical Analysis**: This stage reads the source code and converts it into
   a sequence of tokens representing the basic elements of the language (such
   as keywords, identifiers, operators, etc.).

2. **Syntactic Analysis**: In this stage, the compiler constructs an abstract
   syntax tree (AST) from the token sequence. The syntax rules of the MiniJava
   language are validated here.

3. **Semantic Analysis**: During this phase, the code is checked for semantic
   correctness, ensuring that expressions, data types, and declarations are
   valid (for example, checking that variables are used after being declared).

4. **Code Generation**: Finally, the intermediate code is converted into
   specific instructions for the virtual machine, ready to be executed.

## Supported Features

The compiler supports the following language features:

- **Class Declaration**: Classes with attributes and methods can be declared.
- **Methods**: Support for methods with parameters and return types, both
  static and non-static.
- **Method Overloading**: It is possible to define multiple methods with the
  same name but a different number of parameters.
- **Inheritance**: Basic support for class inheritance.
- **Primitive Types**: Support for types such as `int`, `char`, `boolean`, and
  `String`.
- **Basic Operators**: Support for arithmetic, logical, and comparison
  operators.
- **Wrapper Classes**: Support for wrapper classes `Integer`, `Character`, and
  `Boolean`.
- **Control Flow**: `if`, `if-else`, `switch` statements, and `while`, `for`,
  and `foreach` loops.
- **Attribute Hiding**: Support for hiding inherited attributes. 
- **Super Access**: Support for accessing the superclass constructors, methods,
  and attributes.
- **Standard Library Methods**: The compiler provides a standard library of
  classes, such as `System` with methods for output and input handling.

## Unsupported Features

The following features are currently not supported:

- **Operator Precedence**: All operators have the same precedence and are left
  associative.
- **Class Visibility**: No support for class visibility, but visibility in
  methods and attributes is supported.
- **Exceptions**: No support for exception handling (`try-catch`).
- **Interfaces**: Support for interfaces is not yet available.
- **Abstract Classes**: Support for abstract classes is not yet available.
- **Generics**: No support for generic classes or methods has been implemented.
- **Arrays**: No support for arrays.
- **Increment and Decrement Operators**: No support for increment and decrement
  operators has been ihttps://github.com/lagosmanuel/compiler-minjava/tree/main/srcmplemented, but they can be replaced with the augmented
  assignment operators `+=` and `-=`.
- **Float Type**: No support for the `Float` type.
- **Short-Circuit Logical Operators**: The logical operators `&&` and `||` are
  implemented with eager evaluation, not short-circuit evaluation.

## Grammar

The LL(1) Context-Free Grammar of the language's syntax can be found in the file 
[grammar.txt](resources/grammar/syntax-grammar.txt).
